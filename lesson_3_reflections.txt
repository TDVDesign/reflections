Q:  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A:  You would want to use a remote repository for sharing your work with the public, or collaboration with others.  It also works as a cloud backup.

Q:  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A:  If Git stays up to date automatically, and you are working on a file, it might try to change the file you are working on.  Rather, when you are ready, you can check for updates.
