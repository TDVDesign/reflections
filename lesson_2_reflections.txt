Q:  What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

A:  When you initialize a repository, it creates the metadata in a hidden .git file that contains revision history, etc.  This needs to be done to keep track of commits and versions.

Q:  What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?  How would branches help?

A:  Branches would be helpful with experimental changes that you would not necessarily want the main branch to follow.  Changes can be added to the main branch later.  

Q:  How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

A:  Making a diagram of the commits and branches help to show visually where they occur, and what branches can reach which commits.

Q:  What is the result of merging two branches together?  Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

A:  Merging the two branches together creates one branch that can access both branch's commits
